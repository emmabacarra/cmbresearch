The ACTPol EE, TT and TE power spectra are released here with their corresponding window functions and simulated covariance matrix. We also include the BB spectra in two wide bins. In addition we release the EE and TT N_l curves for the various patches. The effective noise power spectrum consist of the noise power spectrum divided by the beam window function.

The Cl spectra are binned, and are given with the following columns:
-the mean multipole moment l
-the power spectrum in units of \mu K^2 C_l
-the error for the binned value in units of \mu K^2 C_l

These are the data shown in Figure 10. of Louis et al.

For statistical comparison to a theory Cl, the theory Cls should be convolved with bandpower window functions.  Any likelihood analysis should be performed using the corresponding CMB-only likelihood provided.

The combined CMB-only bandpowers (marginalised over astrophysical foregrounds) are given in the cmbonly tarball.

The ACTPol EE and TT noise curves are given as:

- multipole moment l
- the noise power spectrum in units of \mu K^2 N_l for D5
- the noise power spectrum in units of \mu K^2 N_l for D6
- the noise power spectrum in units of \mu K^2 N_l for D56 PA1
- the noise power spectrum in units of \mu K^2 N_l for D56 PA2

These are the curves shown in Fig. 8 of Louis et al.
