    "CMB Temperature Variations:\n",
    "- WMAP measures the temperature of CMB radiation across the sky.\n",
    "- It shows slight variations or fluctuations, not uniform (anisotropic)\n",
    "- These fluctuations resemble ripples on a pond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causes of Temperature Variations:\n",
    "- Variations in gas density or velocity at the surface of last scatter.\n",
    "- Variations in the gravitational potential at the surface of last scatter and along photon path.\n",
    "- Different physical phenomena cause each effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular Fluctuation Spectrum:\n",
    "- CMB temperature measured in smaller patches of the sky.\n",
    "- Represented by an \"angular fluctuation spectrum\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations in Gravity (Large Scales):\n",
    "- Main fluctuations due to gravity strength variations at last scatter.\n",
    "- Dark matter density largely determines gravitational potential variations.\n",
    "- Early universe likely featureless, inflation may have caused initial variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imprint of Sound Waves (Small Scales):\n",
    "- Sound waves in ionized hydrogen gas leave imprints.\n",
    "- Regions of compression in sound waves appear brighter or hotter.\n",

    "\n",
    "- COBE Sky Map: uncorrected dipole temperature shift across the sky.\n",
    "- Radiometric Gain: Proportionality constant between input temperature difference and output voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WMAP Microwave System:\n",
    "- Consists of ten 4-channel 'differencing assemblies'.\n",
    "- Each assembly receives signals from a pair of feeds observing the sky.\n",
    "- Output is proportional to temperature (brightness) difference between the two lines of sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration Process:\n",
    "- Intrinsic random asymmetries in assemblies generate offsets in output data.\n",
    "- Signals calibrated against known microwave sources for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dipole Effect:\n",
    "- Result of Earth, solar system, and galaxy movement through the universe.\n",
    "- Similar to change in sound pitch passing by a source in a car or train.\n",
    "- CMB temperature 6.706 mK brighter in one sky direction than the opposite.\n",
